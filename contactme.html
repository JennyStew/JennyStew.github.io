		<h3>Here's what folks are saying...</h3>
		<p>"My daughter, Reese, has been participating in music therapy with Kelly since April of 2016. In that time, I've noticed a great improvement in her communication and social skills. She can now imitate a beat, sing, and dance. We are thrilled with music therapy. It is one of the best things we've ever done for Reese. Best of all, she absloutely loves music therapy with Kelly!"<br>
			<em>Leslie, Reese's mom</em><br>
			"Kelly is highly recommended. She is extremely caring, compassionate, and strives to help every child excel. During music therapy sessions, she incorporates many different skills including gross motor, fine motor, speech, skills, etc. to better each child she touches. My daughter looks forward to sessions with Ms. Kelly as each session is fun and beneficial and has helped her improve in so many ways. We are so thankful for Ms. Kelly and her extremely kind nature and also her interest in each individual child to better them in every way possible."<br>
			<em>Becky, Avery's mom</em><br>
			"She's OK I guess. Kind of smelly."<br>
