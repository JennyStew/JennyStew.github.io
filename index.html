<p class="par2">Greetings & Salutations!<br>

	I am so pleased that you have chosen Life Dynamic Music Therapy, and hope that your journey to and through music therapy will provide you with the best support and care you could imagine.  I would like to welcome you, and take the time to share with you about myself.  My name is Kelly Garland-Egeler, and I am a Board-Certified Music Therapist.  I have been practicing music therapy since 2010, as a graduate of Eastern Michigan University.  I have worked with many different people with a range of abilities and challenges, including infants in NICU, children and adults with special needs (especially autism), adults with cancer in an outpatient psych-oncology clinic, and adults with cognitive and memory loss.<br>

	From these experiences, I have gained a sense of appreciation and earnestness in practice for the unique needs of the people I have cared for - the need for social justice, compassion, commitment, and unconditional positive regard.  Each moment and experience I have had practicing as a music therapist has been a cherished learning experience for me, and I will continue to explore, learn, and try novel approaches to develop and improve my clinical practice in order to provide the best possible outcomes for you and your loved one.<br> 

	Please don’t hesitate to communicate with me; I am happy to hear your thoughts, suggestions, concerns, and feedback.<br>

<div class="testimonials">
<p>"My daughter, Reese, has been participating in music therapy with Kelly since April of 2016. In that time, I've noticed a great improvement in her communication and social skills. She can now imitate a beat, sing, and dance. We are thrilled with music therapy. It is one of the best things we've ever done for Reese. Best of all, she absloutely loves music therapy with Kelly!"<br>
<em>Leslie, Reese's mom</em><br>
<br>
"Kelly is highly recommended. She is extremely caring, compassionate, and strives to help every child excel. During music therapy sessions, she incorporates many different skills including gross motor, fine motor, speech, skills, etc. to better each child she touches. My daughter looks forward to sessions with Ms. Kelly as each session is fun and beneficial and has helped her improve in so many ways. We are so thankful for Ms. Kelly and her extremely kind nature and also her interest in each individual child to better them in every way possible."<br>
<em>Becky, Avery's mom</em><br>
<br>
"Music therapy was a great way to have fun and get therapy all in one. My son enjoyed his sessions every week! We love our music therapist ♥."<br>
